# Objects and The Dot

To better understand objects, you have to understand how they reside within the memory. Recall that objects are name / value pairs that can contain children name / value pairs. An object can have the following...

_OBJECT_
* Primitive (property)
* Object    (property)
* Function  (method)

Within the memory, the object will have addresses within the memory that reference its different properties.
