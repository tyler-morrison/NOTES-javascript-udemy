When using functional programming, do your best not to *mutate* data. You can quickly find yourself in strange circumstances when you start to change the data as itâ€™s being passed around.

One good reference of functional programming is [UnderscoreJS Annotated source](http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html) and [LoDash](https://lodash.com/).
