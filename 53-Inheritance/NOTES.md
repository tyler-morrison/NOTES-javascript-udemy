# Object-Oriented Javascript and Prototypal Inheritance

## Classical vs Prototypal Inheritance

*Inheritance* = One object getting access to the properties and methods of another object.

**Classical Inheritance** is currently part of what’s best known and popular, via languages like C# and Java. It is not bad, per se, but thinking that this is the only approach is wrong. This process can be very verbose, even if using good practices.

**Prototypal Inheritance** is much simpler, more flexible, and easier to understand. When we discuss inheritance with Javascript, we need to understand that it’s very different from that concept within other languages.
