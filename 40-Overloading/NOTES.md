# Function Overloading

In other programming languages, like C++, there is a concept known as *function overloading* - creating functions with the same name, but different parameters. It does not matter that this is missing from Javascript, because the ability to use first-class functions gives us a wider variety of options.

Function overloading will not work in Javascript, because functions are objects.

## Alternatives to Using Function Overloading
* Create defaults within the functions via the Logical OR Operator
