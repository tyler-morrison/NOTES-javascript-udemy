# Everything is an Object (or a Primitive)

Everything eventually leads to the *Base Object*. It is a built-in object that sits at the highest level of the ‘prototype chain’. Thus, we're able to access certain properties and methods from anywhere in the code.

For functions, you will see methods that we've already discussed - call(), bind(), apply(), etc.

Similarly for arrays, you have certain base methods from the Base Object - push(), length(), etc.
